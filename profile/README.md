I'm the founder of **DreamLab AI Consulting Ltd.**, providing specialist consultancy and R&D services focused on the strategic implementation of cutting-edge technologies. My core areas of expertise include:

*   ü§ñ **Generative AI & Agentic Systems:** Developing and integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), diffusion models (like Stable Diffusion via ComfyUI), and designing complex AI workflows and agentic architectures. Expertise in AI Ops and product development (Patents Pending).
*   üåê **Spatial Computing & Immersive Experiences:** Leveraging 25+ years in mixed reality, telepresence (PhD focus), virtual production, and human-computer interaction. Designing and building high-performance visualisation platforms and collaborative environments (e.g., CAVE systems, large screen XR).
*   üîó **Decentralised Technologies & Protocols:** Researching and applying technologies like Bitcoin, Lightning Network, and Nostr for secure, transparent, and equitable access, governance, micro-transactions, and novel economic models within digital spaces.
*   üß† **Knowledge Management & GraphRAG:** Developing advanced systems like VisionFlow, transforming knowledge bases (e.g., Logseq) into interactive 3D visualisations using WebXR, GPU acceleration, and AI-enhanced analysis (Graph RAG).
*   üîß **Open Source Development:** Committed to contributing open-source tools and research outputs. You can find relevant work primarily across my personal repositories and the [DreamLab-AI GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/DreamLab-AI). <!-- Adjust org link if needed -->

DreamLab AI Consulting Ltd. is an integral part of the broader **DreamLab collective** based at MediaCityUK, Manchester. As Associate Director R&D within this group of ~25 leading creative technologists, I help steer engineering management and innovation, particularly focusing on AI-assisted workflows, immersive technology, access, governance, and ethics. We are an HP AI Lighthouse Partner.

## Research Philosophy & Focus

My work is driven by the convergence of AI, spatial computing, and decentralised systems. I am particularly interested in:

*   **Augmented Intelligence:** Using AI not just to automate, but to enhance human creativity, collaboration, and decision-making.
*   **Equity of Access:** Exploring how open protocols and decentralised infrastructure can provide more equitable access to advanced digital tools and economic opportunities, particularly for underserved global communities.
*   **Convergence & Disruption:** Analysing how these technologies are merging and fundamentally reshaping industries, collaboration patterns, and digital society. I have a long-standing interest in Bitcoin as a non-trivial disruptive force.
*   **Trust & Governance in Digital Spaces:** Designing systems that are transparent, verifiable, and support robust governance models for both human and AI actors.

I believe in building practical, impactful solutions grounded in deep technical understanding and a commitment to open collaboration.
